What pages am I going to need-
	index- front page that displays the list of reddit type questions
	question page- the individual question that is first asked. it will display the whole question and then some more explanation about the question in the paragraph below.

	bottom of the question page- form to respond to peoples questions

style-
	I am going to try to make it look like reddit if I can. If I dont have as much time I think I will use bootstrap and or google materialize to style the page to my liking.
